# Introduction

Xtension provides easy and useful extensions on Dart classes that can help you in any project, so you don't have to write them yourself and you don't need to copy files with extensions across projects.

## Object

<pre>
    String str = "Dart is amazing!";
    
    print(str); /// output Dart is amazing

    // Or even shorter
    String str = "Dart is amazing!"..log;
</pre>
